# Student-Management-System
The Student Management System is set to modernize academic data handling. This system ensures streamlined result management, minimizes errors, and empowers educators with insightful performance analytics. The system includes two modules, student and admin, for storing, retrieving and managing students' academic performance.

The main goal of our project is to serve as a
comprehensive and efficient tool designed to streamline the process of
managing and disseminating academic results. With a user-friendly
interface, it facilitates seamless input, storage, and retrieval of student
performance data. The system aims to enhance administrative efficiency by
automating result generation, reducing manual errors, and providing quick
access to accurate academic records. Additionally, it empowers educators
to analyze and track student progress over time, fostering informed
decision-making. Ultimately, the Student Management System contributes
to a transparent and organized educational environment, promoting
effective communication between students, teachers, and administrators.
